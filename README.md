# Giant List of Everything
Just a giant list of everything that matters, from tech, to politics to everything in between

NB: Anything listed here is neither implicitly or explicitly endorsed or condoned by myself. Some listing may include things that are deemed important on the surface until dug into deeper. In essence, it is a list of things that may matter, pending future deeper consumption. This list is intended to be a forever living document. As the world changes, new and more relevant topics will be surfaced while older topics moved to an archive of sorts through commit history
